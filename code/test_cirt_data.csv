CSCI-5050*,Professional Masters Project 2*,"Second class in a two-semester cycle. Focuses on applied best practice in all facets of software engineering in industry and the application of those practices. Students are part of a development team involved in a two-semester project. Each student has a specific role on the project, and all will be responsible for some level of actual software development. The second semester focuses on development, code construction, and delivery, using agile-based project management for development. Students work in both Scrum and Kanban agile project cycles. Testing, soft skills for teamwork, project management, and other supporting aspects will be driven throughout the semester. The outcome of the two-semester cycle is a final project delivery of a software product for an institutional or industrial partner and/or for entry into software development competitions.*",3*,"Spring 2026 001: Student may be dropped from course for non-attendance,Requires prerequisite course of CSCI 5040 (minimum grade of B).*",Restricted to CSEN-MSCPS graduate students only.*,CSEN-MSCPS: Projects;NTEN-MSNE: Not Applicable;CSEN-MS: Not Applicable;CSEN-PHD: Not Applicable*,Agile (Scrum, Kanban) and Waterfall Software Project Management, Software Requirements, Software Architecture Design, Risk Management, Code Reviews, C#, DevOps, Software Test, Team Leadership*
